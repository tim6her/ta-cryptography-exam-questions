## Cryptography principles

*  Confidentiality / secrecy:
    -  limit access to information
*  Data Integrity
    -  data was not altered (intentionally or accidentally)
    -  detection of alteration (not prevention)
*  Data origin authentication / message authentication
    -  confirms the origin of data with no temporal aspect to the **receiver**
    -  not necessarily an immediate source / not when
*  Entity authentication
    -  a given entity is involved and currently active
    -  e.g. log in at web service
*  Non-Repudiation
    -  a source of data cannot deny to a **third party** being at the origin

Data origin authentication $⇒$ Data integrity

Non-Repudiation $⇒$ Data origin authentication

Data origin authentication $≠$ Entity authentication

Secrecy $\not⇒$ Data origin authentication

## Different cryptographic concepts

*  Cryptography = **toolkit**
*  Cryptographic **primitive** = a basic tool in this toolkit
   -  Examples:
      Encryption, hash function, MAC (message authentication code),
      digital signature, etc.
*  Cryptographic **algorithm** = Cipher = a specification of a primitive
*  Cryptographic **protocol** = a way to choose primitives and use them
   for a security goal
*  Crypto**system** = implementation of primitives and the infrastructure

## Basic model of a cryptosystem

![Basic model of a cryptosystem [@Martin2012]](./imgs/basic_model_for_secrecy.png){#fig:basic_model}

@Fig:basic_model depicts a sender who wishes to transfer some data to a receiver
in such a way that any party intercepting the transmitted data cannot determine
the content. *The interceptor must not know the decryption key.*

Secrecy can be provided by (combination of):

1. Cryptography (via encryption)
2. Steganography (via information hiding)
3. Access control (via software or hardware)

## Definition of Cryptosystem

Cryptosystem is a $5$-tuple $(\mathcal{P, C, K, E, D})$ satisfying:

* $\mathcal{P}$ is a finite set of possible **plaintexts**;
* $\mathcal{C}$ is a finite set of possible **ciphertexts**;
* $\mathcal{K}$, the keyspace, is a finite set of possible **keys**;
* $\mathcal{E} = \lbrace{E_k : k ∈ \mathcal{K}}\rbrace$ consists of **encryption
  functions** $E_k : \mathcal{P → C}$;
* $\mathcal{D} = \lbrace{D_k : k ∈ \mathcal{K}}\rbrace$ consists of **decryption
  functions** $D_k : \mathcal{C → P}$;
* For all $e ∈ \mathcal{K}$ there exists $d ∈ \mathcal{K}$ such that for all
  plaintexts $p ∈ \mathcal{P}$ we have:
  $$D_d(E_e(p)) = p$$

The cryptosystem is

*  **symmetric** if $e = d$ and
*  **public-key** if $d$ cannot be derived from $e$ in a computationally
   feasible way
